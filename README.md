# EZ Storage Software

EZSS is a lightweight but limited storage server for your uploading needs. 
It was made because I couldn't find anything that was simple and quick to start up.

# THIS PROJECT IS IN VERY EARLY ACCESS

## Usage

### Starting up the server is as simple as running 2 commands

```bash
> npm i
> npm start
```
#### Change the name in "vault.config.js" in order to personalize the vault home page a little bit.





## Plans for the future

  - **Authentication system**
  - **File icons**
  - **Display file size in table**
  - **Better way of saving time uploaded**
